# Governed Model Logic (GML) â€“ v1.0.0

GML is a declarative, versioned logic format for transparent, trust-governed execution.  
It is designed to support decision systems, audit trails, and justification across domains â€” from digital claims to public service eligibility to human rights enforcement.

This repository contains the **canonical schema**, governance rules, version history, and example logic.
