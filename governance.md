# GML Schema Governance

This schema is governed under a covenant-based model, provisionally stewarded by The Covenant Trust.

### ðŸ‘¥ Steward Responsibilities

- Maintain the integrity and version history of the GML schema
- Approve or reject proposed changes based on public benefit, auditability, and interoperability
- Publish changelogs and upgrade policies
- Provide transparent access to all schema revisions and usage licenses

---

### ðŸ“œ Governance Principles

- Logic must be explainable
- Execution must be traceable
- Control must be separable from stewardship
- Changes must not create silent divergence in regulated environments

The schema is maintained on a public, auditable, and versioned basis.

Future governance may transition to:
- Federated standards bodies
- Inter-jurisdictional consortia
- Domain-specific ethics boards

All decisions are recorded publicly in this repository.
